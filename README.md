# Water Rocket Optimization & Launch Mechanism

## 📌 Project Overview
* **Objective:** Designed, calculated, and launched a pressurized water rocket system to analyze fluid dynamics, thrust optimization, and mechanical release systems.
* **Context:** Collaborative academic project for the BSc in Vehicle Engineering program at Széchenyi István University.

## ⚙️ My Specific Contributions
* **Releasing Mechanism Design:** I conceptualized and integrated a custom remote launch system. By modifying a garden hose connector and linking it to a bicycle brake cable and handle, I created a reliable, high-pressure quick-release mechanism.
* **Thermodynamic & Kinematic Calculations:** Developed an iterative mathematical model in Excel to simulate the rocket's flight according the instructions provided.
* **Optimization:** Calculated the optimal initial water volume and optimal air pressure to maximize $F_{thrust}$ over time while minimizing the depletion rate of the pressurized gas. 

## 🛠️ Technical Tools & Concepts Applied
* **Software:** Microsoft Excel (for complex iterative modeling), Microsoft PowerPoint.
* **Applied Mechanics:** Drag reduction (utilizing a three-fin design and a tennis ball nose cone for aerodynamic stability).
* **Safety Engineering:** Implemented an extended silicon tube and remote brake-cable trigger to ensure operator safety during high-pressure testing.
